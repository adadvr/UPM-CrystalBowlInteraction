# How to add to your Unity Project ?

Use the package manager and choose "add from a git URL", then put the 
<code> https://github.com/adadvr/UPM-CrystalBowlInteraction.git </code> and install it

Import the samples folder in your Asset folder unity project and open the scene called <b>"PolarMovementExample"</b>

Once you have opened the scene you can test in play mode. At this moment we have only the movement of the prefab <b>"Interactor"</b> from the <b>Scene view</b> with play mode running for test purpose, so in the <b>"Game mode view"</b> is not working yet.
